Hello, you have reached [my](/aboutme) personal website.  
Not sure if i would regularly update this, but I will try to keep it up to date.

If you know me personally, you would know that I am Mathematics shitposter and, to a lesser extent, a Computer Science nerd too.
I hope that this website will be a good place to share my thoughts and ideas, as well as some of the things I have been working on.
If you are a math nerd as well, you might find some of the things I have been working on interesting.
If you are a recruiter, you might find my [CV](/files/CV/cv_single.pdf) interesting.
If you are not a math nerd, you can refer to the "non math stuff" section below.
<!-- If you have something to tell and wish to do so anonymously, you may drop a message [here](www.google.com). [Here](/responses) are my responses to (some of) your messages. -->

I am not a web developer, but I would recommend using Jekyll if you are looking to make a personal website.

(This is most likely not a very good measure since it updates with every refresh but oh, well.)
