“The other thing that’s a big danger for CS students is spending too much time on stuff that doesn’t matter. Like writing a website for yourself. That doesn’t count. You have to work on real problems.”
— Paul Graham, from a talk at Stanford (2006)

"You should also not trust everything you read on the internet."
— Me, from a website I made

# Welcome to my website!

If you know me personally, you would know that I am Mathematics shitposter and, to a lesser extent, a Computer Science nerd too.
* I hope that this website will be a good place to share my thoughts and ideas, as well as some of the things I have been working on.
* If you are a math nerd as well, you might find some of the things I have been working on interesting.
<!-- If you are a recruiter, you might find my [CV](/files/CV/cv_single.pdf) interesting. -->
* If you are not a math nerd, you can refer to the "non math stuff" section below.
<!-- If you have something to tell and wish to do so anonymously, you may drop a message [here](www.google.com). [Here](/responses) are my responses to (some of) your messages. -->


# Links
## Math(and by extension, computer science) stuff

This website was made using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/).
I am not a web developer, but I would recommend using Jekyll if you are looking to make a personal website.

(This is most likely not a very good measure since it updates with every refresh but oh, well.)
