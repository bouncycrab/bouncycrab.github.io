Here is a list of some questions from [Math StackExchange](https://math.stackexchange.com){:target="_blank"}. 
They are either here because the technique used was elegant or the result itself was elegant.

<!-- ### galois-theory

0. [If $$K/\mathbb{Q}$$ is finite, then there exists a finite extension $$E/K$$ which is not normal.](https://math.stackexchange.com/a/4184243/427810){:target="_blank"}

0. [An elementary way of counting the number of generators of $$\mathbb{F}_{q^{n}}$$ over $$\mathbb{F}_{q}$$.](https://math.stackexchange.com/a/4087728/427810){:target="_blank"}  
Interestingly, a similar question came up in a test I gave few months later. I started doing it in a more complicated way (similar to my other answer on that question) but then I remembered I had done this special case in an easier way on this post.

0. [Computing the Galois group of $$\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt[6]{-3})/\mathbb{Q}$$.](https://math.stackexchange.com/a/4169160/427810){:target="_blank"} -->

### Elementary-group-theory

0. [If $$H$$ is a subgroup of $$G$$ with smallest prime index, then $$H$$ is normal in $$G$$.](https://math.stackexchange.com/a/1825321/427810){:target="_blank"} - Very elegant classification of a subgroup given a small index. Noticably, the intended proof using elementary group theory is not the most elegant one. This proof does it with group actions which is so much cooler.

0. [A group of order $$p^2$$ is abelian.](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/212084/group-with-order-p2-must-be-abelian-how-to-prove-that){:target="_blank"} - A very nice proof using the class equation.

0. [Group of order $p^2q^2$ cannot be simple.](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/138086/a-group-of-order-p2q2-is-never-simple){:target="_blank"}

0. [Proper subgroups of finite p-groups are properly contained in the normalizer](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/168963/proper-subgroups-of-finite-p-groups-are-properly-contained-in-the-normalizer) - I love proofs by group actions. This one is a very nice example of that.

0. [Conjugate elements of G that are in the center of a Sylow p-subgroup](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/182104/conjugate-elements-of-g-that-are-in-the-center-of-a-sylow-p-subgroup) - Notice that a collorary of this is that if P-group is abelian, then this holds too.
### analysis

0. [Lipschitz continuity vs Uniform continuity](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/3518786/what-is-the-difference-between-lipschitz-and-general-uniform-continuity){:target="_blank"}


### number-theory

0. [Proving that a certain composition of two integer polynomials has no integer solution.](https://math.stackexchange.com/a/4194156/427810){:target="_blank"}

0. [Prove that $ùëé^2+1$ cannot have prime factor of the form 4ùëò+3](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/2006031/prove-that-a2-1-cannot-have-prime-factor-of-the-form-4k-3) - I had to use this fact for some math competition. Proof elegant using group theory...

### linear-algebra

0. [Difference between Homomorphism and Linear Map](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/29944/difference-between-linear-map-and-homomorphism){:target="_blank"}
